"N" particles interacting via Lennard-Jones potential, evolving by "Eulers Method" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method).Test would be to check that the total energy is conserved. 

While you can program in your favourite programming language, I suggest using Python for ease of debugging (Use NumPy module of Python).

Submit the program, make sure you have enough "comment" lines to make it understandbale; also submit input valuse/files and output files. And how the check for conservation of total energy was performed.

Deadline: 3:30pm today.
